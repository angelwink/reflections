When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So you can publish code for others to see and/or contribute

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want to synch up every little changes because it's time consuming, you want to define a logical change that is significant enough to do a synch.
